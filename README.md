# Mapping_Earthquakes

CWRU Data Analytics Module Thirteen Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved using geoJSON data from the US Geological Survey to generate earthquake and tectonic plate maps in an interactive web page.  

### Summary

The effort involved using the D3 and Leaflet libraries with javascript to load JSON data for recent earthquakes and tectonic data from the USGS site and then use MapBox to generate maps illustrating earthquake locations and magnitudes.  Interactive controls were added to show different layers and visual effects such as nighttime, satellite, light and street views.  

## Major components of the work:

The Challenge is built upon work done in the module, where recent earthquake maps were built and rendered

### Deliverable 1: 
involved adding data for tectonic plates, adding a layer to the earthquake map to display the tectonic plate outlines and adding the tectonic plates as part of the interactive controls for the page 

* Tectonic plates

* Adding interactive controls

### Deliverable 2: 
involved adding major earthquake data as a layer to the map, as for tectonic plates.  As these overlay with the existing earthquake data it was necessary to modify the rendering so that the major earthquakes could be easily visible on the map

* Major earthquakes

### Deliverable 3: 
add a third map style to the page - I actually added two more:  light and satellite 


* Satellite

* Light
